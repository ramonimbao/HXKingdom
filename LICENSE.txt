Note from the author: 

The reason I included this license is not to limit anyone in their option
to learn from, modify, and show off this code, but only to prevent people
making a quick buck by compiling the game for mobile devices and selling
it. I'd also hate to see clones of the Flash version with ads plastered
all over them. If you make an entirely new game out of the assets here, 
I'm fine with that too, and you can go ahead and make as much money off 
of that as you want. So please, go ahead and download the code, mess with 
it, and show the results to all your friends (and me! :).

As for the Haxe code...
